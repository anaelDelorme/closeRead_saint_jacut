Just saying its name brings forth images of my childhood, bathed in light and salt.\n\nIt's a village nestled in the heart of the Côtes-d'Armor, a nearly unreal peninsula where the sea and land whisper secrets to each other. Every summer, we would gather there—my brother, my parents, and a large tribe of cousins whose laughter filled the streets and beaches. The days seemed endless, split between card games on the beach, intense foosball matches at La Frégate, and long hours spent gazing at the horizon.\n\nAnd that horizon... It always led to the Ébihens archipelago, a wild gem we reached on foot at low tide, as if crossing into another world. Even now, I return there with my own children. It's like passing a baton, a tribute to this paradise where time stands still.\n\n\n## Discovering a Breton Paradise \n\n\n\n```{ojs}\nbertin = require(\"bertin\")\n```\n\n```{ojs}\nregs = FileAttachment(\"data/reg_francemetro_2024.json\").json();\ndeps = FileAttachment(\"data/dep_reg_53_2024.json\").json();\ncom = FileAttachment(\"data/commune22302_dep_22_2024.json\").json();\n```\n\n```{ojs}\nbretagne = bertin.properties.subset({\n    geojson: regs,\n    field: \"code\",\n    selection: [\"53\"],\n    inverse: false\n})\n\n\ndep22 = bertin.properties.subset({\n    geojson: deps,\n    field: \"code\",\n    selection: [\"22\"],\n    inverse: false\n})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\nzoom = {return { \n            type: \"Polygon\",\n            coordinates:  [[[x_min,y_min],[x_min,y_max],[x_max,y_max],[x_max,y_min],[x_min,y_min]]]\n            \n          }\n        }\n        \nmer = {return { \n            type: \"Polygon\",\n            coordinates:  [[[0, 6000000],[0,7500000],[1200000,7500000],[1200000,6000000],[0, 6000000]]]\n            \n          }\n        } \n```\n\n```{ojs}\n\nprojection = d3.geoIdentity()\n\t.reflectY(true)\n\t.fitSize([width/2, width /2 ], zoom);\n\n```\n\n```{ojs}\nprogression = crProgressBlock\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nBrittany, a land of ancient mysteries and forgotten horizons, stands like a sentinel at the western edge of Eurasia, boldly thrusting its rocky head towards the tumultuous waters of the Atlantic. There, at the world's edge, its landscapes stretch like whispers of eternity.\n\nFor those who venture to these distant lands, after long journeys along winding roads, Brittany reveals its secret: it is not just a peninsula, but a kingdom of endless overlaps, a fractal dance where every cape hides another, where every promontory seems to whisper the history of centuries.\n\nTraveler, behold! These shores are not just simple lands, but fragments of the Great Weave. Here, geography itself tells the epic of a land shaped by the ocean and the wind, a frontier between here and elsewhere, the known and the infinite.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\n//| code-fold: false\nx_min_f = d3.scaleLinear()\n  .domain((progression<=.5 ?

It tells us a well-known truth: in Brittany, it rains often. Almost every day, the sky deposits its droplets on the roofs of Saint-Jacut. Compared to other regions, this regularity is unique: in Perpignan, it rains on average 55 days a year, less than two months! In Lyon, there are about 95 rainy days annually, almost one in three. Biarritz, with its oceanic influences, exceeds 130 days, but Saint-Jacut, true to its reputation, flirts with 180 rainy days per year.

Saint-Jacut receives an average of 1,200 mm of rain per year, which places it behind Biarritz, well above Lyon with its 850 mm, and light years ahead of Perpignan, where it's hard to reach 500 mm.

It carries a troubling truth: precipitation is decreasing over the years. Less water, less life... This does not go unnoticed. The Breton lands, fertile for so long, are starting to suffer. The rivers, which meander to the sea, are dwindling. And for shellfish farming, which depends on fresh water to balance the estuaries, this decline is a heavy blow. @cr-pluie-tendance\n\n::::\n\nSo what to do, facing this withdrawing sky? Should we get used to a drier, more fragile Brittany? The soils, agriculture, and even shellfish farming cannot do without this precious water. Maybe it is time to look more seriously at these curves and listen to their message, because behind these numbers, a changing Brittany is emerging...\n \n\\\n\\\n\\\n*Created by [Anaël Delorme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana%C3%ABl-delorme-573b8858/) and [François Semecurbe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoissemecurbe), greatly assisted by ChatGPT and Claude.ai.*\n\n",
